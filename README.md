# Workout app Backend

This is the backend for the "Workout app"

An application to help you plan and store you exercises in personalized workouts.

Select the exercises you want to include in your workout, give it a name, get started! 
Reorder inside your workouts using drag and drop and mark them as done as you go.

Workout app was initially a "Hack day" project during the bootcamp, where I got to develop an app from scratch in one day.
